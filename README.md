# OneLuaPro
**OneLuaPro** is ...

- a portable, monolithic distribution of the [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) programming language for the Windows operation system (should run from Windows 7 on upwards),
- natively build with MSVC compilers, without the unnecessary overhead of a complete MS Visual Studio installation,
- provided as `Win32` and `x64` binaries,
- targeted for corporate application scenarios on computers without permanent Internet access.

**OneLuaPro** is not ...

- made for compatibility with Lua package managers like `luarocks` .

**OneLuaPro** does not ...

- provide a complete Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Instead, it is designed to have a small installation footprint.

**OneLuaPro** can ...

- be build and installed with minimum effort and toolchain-footprint as all its components are prepared for the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build infrastructure.
- be installed entirely without administrative privileges using the released zip-archives.

## Contents of the OneLuaPro Distribution

**OneLuaPro** comprises not only the Lua programming language binaries, but also a number of mature and widely-used extensions in their respective most recent version, all of which tailored to **OneLuaPro**'s requirements:

## Installation of released OneLuaPro Binaries

Download released zip-archive and unpack in a directory of your choice. The maintainer of this distribution suggest to install OneLuaPro into `c:\Apps`. Manually extend `PATH` -variable to the `bin` directory of your installation, e.g. `C:\Apps\OneLuaPro-Win32\bin`. Documentation and code examples (if available) are located in `<OneLuaPro_Install_Path>\share\doc`.

## Building and Installing OneLuaPro from Source Code

A complete Microsoft Visual Studio Installation is optional but not strictly necessary. Simply install **Buildtools for Visual Studio 2022, Version 17.5.5** from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022 and select  the following suggested components for download and installation:

- MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++-x64/x86-Buildtools
- C++-CMake-Tools for Windows (Version 3.25.1-msvc1)
- Windows 11-SDK (10.0.22621.0) 

Open `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` and change drive and directory. Download and unpack sources or simply clone this repository:

```cmd
c:
cd c:\Temp
git clone git@github.com:KritzelKratzel/OneLuaPro.git
cd OneLuaPro
```

CMake strongly encourages out-of-source builds. **OneLuaPro** is an CMake Multiple External Projects build for automatic download, update/patch, configure, build and install.

```cmd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A <arch>
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Available architectures `<arch>` with selected `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator are `Win32`, `x64`, `ARM` and `ARM64`. Default installation directory is `C:\Apps\OneLuaPro-<arch>`, where a directory structure according to [GNU Coding Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html) is created. 

Currently, the `PATH` environment variable has to be extended by the user in order to make `lua` callable from any Windows command prompt. For the current Windows user and without administrative privileges permanently extend the <u>user-specific</u> part of the `PATH` variable by executing the following [two commands](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19287379/) in the given order:

```cmd
for /f "usebackq tokens=2,*" %A in (`reg query HKCU\Environment /v PATH`) do set my_user_path=%B

setx PATH "%my_user_path%;c:\Apps\OneLuaPro-<arch>\bin"
```

Open a new Windows command prompt and verify if Lua is available:

```cmd
C:\Users\John Doe>lua -v
Lua 5.4.6  Copyright (C) 1994-2023 Lua.org, PUC-Rio

C:\Users\John Doe>
```
